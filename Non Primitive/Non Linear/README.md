# Recursion

Before diving into non-linear data structures, it's essential to understand the concept of recursion, how it works, and why it is important in the context of non-linear data structures.

### Recursion and Its Memory Mechanics

Recursion is a programming and mathematical concept where a function or algorithm calls itself to solve a problem. It works by breaking down complex problems into simpler, more manageable instances of the same problem until a base case is reached, where the solution is straightforward.

### How Recursion Works in Memory

Understanding how recursion works in memory is crucial for both writing efficient recursive algorithms and avoiding issues like stack overflow errors.

To illustrate how recursion works in memory, let's consider the example of computing the factorial of 4 using a recursive function. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. The factorial of 4, denoted as 4!, is calculated as follows:

4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24

Let's see the steps with its illustrations:

1. **Function Calls**:
   - When the recursive function `factorial(4)` is called, a new instance of the function is pushed onto the call stack:

     ```
     |               |
     |  factorial(4) |
     |_______________|
     ```

2. **Local Variables**:
   - Each instance of the function has its own set of local variables, which store data specific to that instance of the function. In this case, the local variable `n` is set to 4:

     ```
     |               |
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |
     |_______________|
     ```

3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - Within the function, it checks if `n` is greater than 1. If the condition is met, a new call of the function is added to the top of the stack with `n` decremented by 1:

     ```
     |               |
     |  factorial(1) |
     |     n = 1     |
     |_______________|
     |               |
     |  factorial(2) |
     |     n = 2     |
     |_______________|
     |               |
     |  factorial(3) |
     |     n = 3     |
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |
     |_______________|
     ```

4. **Base Case**:
   - The recursion continues until `n` becomes 1, which is the base case.

     ```
     |               |
     |  factorial(1) |
     |     n = 1     |  <- Base-Case
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(2) |
     |     n = 2     |
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(3) |
     |     n = 3     |
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |
     |_______________|
     ```

5. **Returning Results**:
   - As the recursive calls reach the base case, they start returning results back up the call stack:

     ```
     |               |
     |  factorial(1) |  -> return 1
     |     n = 1     |
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(2) |
     |     n = 2     |  -> return 2 * factorial(1)
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(3) |
     |     n = 3     |  -> return 3 * factorial(2)
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |  -> return 4 * factorial(3)
     |_______________|
     ```

6. **Stack Popping**:
   - Once the base case is reached, the instances of the function on the call stack are gradually popped off, and their results are combined to compute the final result of the original function call:

     ```
     |  factorial(2) |
     |     n = 2     |  -> return 2 * factorial(1)
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(3) |
     |     n = 3     |  -> return 3 * factorial(2)
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |  -> return 4 * factorial(3)
     |_______________|
     ```
   - Then:

     ```
     |  factorial(3) |
     |     n = 3     |  -> return 3 * factorial(2)
     |_______________|
     |  factorial(4) |
     |     n = 4     |  -> return 4 * factorial(3)
     |_______________|
     ```

7. **Popping and Combining Results**:
   - So the stack popping process starts at the base case and proceeds upwards. Results are combined as each function instance returns:

    - Popping `factorial(1)` and calculating the result: `factorial(1) = 1`

    - Popping `factorial(2)` and calculating the result: `factorial(2) = 2 *  factorial(1) = 2`

    - Popping `factorial(3)` and calculating the result: `factorial(3) = 3 * factorial(2) = 6`
    - Popping `factorial(4)` and calculating the result: `factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3) = 24`

8. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is the result of the original function call, `factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3) = 4 * 6 = 24`. The call stack is now empty:

     ```
     |               |
     |               |
     |               |
     |               |
     |               |
     |_______________|
     ```

So, the factorial of 4 is indeed 24, and the call stack has been fully emptied with the "First In, Last Out" order during popping.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is another essential technique in the world of algorithms and problem-solving. It is particularly valuable for solving problems where you need to explore multiple possible solutions and make a series of choices to find the best outcome. Backtracking involves a trial-and-error approach, where you attempt different options, and if they lead to a dead-end, you backtrack and explore other possibilities. Here's how backtracking works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an initial state and set of choices.

2. **Exploration**:
   - Make a choice and move to a new state. If there are multiple options, try them one by one.

3. **Validation**:
   - Check if the current state is a solution. If it is, great! You've found the answer. If not, proceed to the next step.

4. **Recursion**:
   - Recursively explore all the choices and states from the current point.

5. **Backtrack**:
   - If the exploration reaches a point where there are no viable choices, backtrack to the previous state and try a different option.

6. **Termination**:
   - Keep exploring, validating, and backtracking until you find a solution or exhaust all possibilities.

Backtracking is used in various problem-solving scenarios, including puzzles, games, optimization problems, and more. It's especially handy in situations where the search space is vast and trying every option is not feasible. Through intelligent exploration and backtracking, you can efficiently narrow down the search and find the best solution.

### Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful and elegant technique, but it demands careful use to prevent infinite recursion and the consequent stack overflow errors. The vital components of effective recursive algorithms include the proper definition of base cases and the assurance that the recursion converges to these base cases. 

In the realm of non-linear data structures, recursion assumes significance due to its innate ability to navigate and manipulate these intricate data structures. Non-linear data structures, exemplified by trees and graphs, boast intricate hierarchical relationships among their elements, making recursion ideally suited for such contexts. Here are the key reasons underpinning the importance of recursion in this domain:

1. **Natural Hierarchical Representation:** Recursion naturally mirrors the hierarchical organization of non-linear data structures.
2. **Streamlines Complex Operations:** Recursive approaches simplify intricate operations.
3. **Adaptability Across Data Structures:** Recursion offers versatility, accommodating different data structures.
4. **Enforcement of Well-Defined Base Cases:** Recursion mandates clear base cases to ensure termination.
5. **Memory Efficiency:** It utilizes the call stack, conserving memory.
6. **Augmented Code Readability and Maintainability:** Recursive code is inherently more comprehensible and manageable over time.
