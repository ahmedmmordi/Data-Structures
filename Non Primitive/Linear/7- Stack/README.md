# Stack

## Introduction

A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added item is the first to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in various algorithms, data structures, and real-life scenarios to manage and track a collection of items.

In this document, we will explore the concept of a stack, its different implementations based on arrays and linked lists, and discuss their differences. We will also delve into real-life scenarios where stacks are used.

## Stack Types

### Array-based Stack

An array-based stack is implemented using a dynamically resizing array. This type of stack has a fixed capacity and grows as needed when elements are pushed onto it. Some key characteristics of an array-based stack include:

- Constant-time O(1) complexity for push and pop operations.
- Efficient use of memory if the stack size is known in advance.

### Linked List-based Stack

A linked list-based stack is implemented using a singly linked list. Each element in the stack is represented as a node with a reference to the next element. Some key characteristics of a linked list-based stack include:

- Dynamic size, which allows for the efficient use of memory.
- O(1) complexity for push and pop operations.

## Differences between Array-based and Linked List-based Stacks

1. **Memory Usage:**
   - Array-based stacks require a predefined size, which may lead to wasted memory if the stack size varies significantly.
   - Linked list-based stacks use memory more efficiently since they grow dynamically, but they have some overhead in terms of node pointers.

2. **Dynamic Sizing:**
   - Array-based stacks may need resizing when they reach their capacity, which can lead to a performance hit.
   - Linked list-based stacks can grow and shrink seamlessly as elements are added or removed.

3. **Access Time:**
   - Array-based stacks provide faster access to elements due to direct indexing.
   - Linked list-based stacks require traversing the list from the head node, which may lead to slightly slower access times.

4. **Implementation Complexity:**
   - Array-based stacks are relatively simpler to implement.
   - Linked list-based stacks are more complex due to the dynamic nature of linked lists.

## Real-life Scenarios for Using Stacks

1. **Function Call Stack:**
   - In programming, a call stack is used to manage function calls. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the call stack, and when it returns, it is popped off. This allows for tracking the execution flow and handling function calls.

2. **Undo/Redo Functionality:**
   - Many software applications, such as text editors and graphic design software, use stacks to implement undo and redo functionality. The state of an action is pushed onto a stack when performed and popped when undone or redone.

3. **Backtracking in Maze Solvers:**
   - Maze-solving algorithms often use stacks to backtrack when a dead end is encountered. This enables efficient exploration of different paths.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - Stacks are used in evaluating mathematical expressions, such as converting infix expressions to postfix notation and then calculating the result using a stack.

## Conclusion

Stacks are versatile data structures with various implementations and applications in computer science and everyday life. Understanding the different types of stacks and their usage can greatly improve problem-solving and algorithm design. Whether you're writing code or managing tasks, the stack data structure plays a crucial role in many scenarios.
