# Data Structures

## Repository Overview
This repository is dedicated to the comprehensive exploration and implementation of various data structures, encompassing both primitive and non-primitive, within the realm of the C++ programming language.

We use integers exclusively in these data structure classes for practice, without any templates.

## Structured Sections
The repository has been meticulously organized into two distinct sections:

1. **Primitive Data Structures:** This section is focused on fundamental data structures, providing a solid foundation in this domain.

2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures:** In this section, you will find an in-depth examination of more advanced data structures.

## Contents of Each Section
Each section's dedicated folder includes a wealth of resources:

- Code examples
- Detailed explanations
- Full code implementations

## Detailed Documentation
For a deeper understanding and practical usage guidance, kindly consult the README files contained within each type and section.

## Who Will Benefit
This repository caters to both novice and seasoned programmers, offering a wealth of resources and code examples to facilitate a comprehensive grasp of data structures and their effective implementation.

## Introduction

Data structures are a fundamental aspect of computer science and programming. They play a crucial role in organizing and managing data efficiently. In this repository, we explore both primitive and non-primitive data structures, including linear and non-linear structures, using the C++ programming language.

## Primitive Data Structures

Primitive data structures are the basic building blocks of data storage in C++. There are such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans. We'll explore how to work with these data types, their characteristics, and usage in real-world scenarios.

## Non-Primitive Data Structures

Non-primitive data structures, on the other hand, allow us to organize and manage data in more sophisticated ways. They can be categorized into two main types: linear and non-linear data structures.

### Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures organize and store data elements in a sequential manner, where each element has a clear predecessor and successor. This linear organization simplifies the traversal and retrieval of data, as you can follow a well-defined path.

Examples of linear data structures include:

- **Arrays**: Explore one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays in C++, understand their advantages and limitations.
- **Linked Lists**: Learn about singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Implement common operations like insertion and deletion.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Understand the stack and queue data structures, and their applications in algorithm design.

### Non-Linear Data Structures

Non-linear data structures do not organize data in a linear sequence. Data elements are connected in various ways, allowing for more complex relationships between elements. This organization often results in more sophisticated ways to manage and retrieve data. 

Examples of non-linear data structures include:

- **Trees**: Explore binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and other tree structures. Implement tree traversal algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Learn about graphs, graph representations, and algorithms for traversing and searching in graphs.
- **Hash Tables**: Understand the concept of hashing and how hash tables work to provide efficient data retrieval.
